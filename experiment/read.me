# EXPERIMENT NO 6 
# DFT and IDFT
# Aim
To compute DFT and IDFT of a signal using inbuilt functions and manual methods.
Theory:
The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a fundamental mathematical tool used in signal processing, 
communication systems, and many areas of engineering and science. It converts a discrete sequence (signal)
from the time domain into its representation in the frequency domain. The DFT transforms a finite sequence of 
equally spaced samples of a function into a sequence of coefficients of complex sinusoids, ordered by their frequencies.
The Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) is a mathematical process that converts a sequence of complex numbers
in the frequency domain back into the time domain. It is the inverse operation of the Discrete Fourier 
Transform (DFT) and is used to recover the original time-domain sequence from its DFT.
