                               LINEAR CONVOLUTION

Aim

a)To find linear convolution using built in function
b) To find linear convolution without using built in function

THEORY
Linear convolution is a mathematical operation used in signal processing 
to combine two signals, 
often to understand how one signal modifies another.
It operates by sliding one function over another, multiplying
corresponding values, and summing the products at each step.

This process evaluates how much the signal h(n), often called the impulse response, 
overlaps with the input signal x(n). Linear convolution is used for filtering,
smoothing, and analyzing system responses in digital and analog signal processing. 
The result of the convolution is usually a signal whose length is the sum of the 
lengths of the two input signals minus one.
